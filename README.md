# Bookshop-app

TASK: Create a provisional version of a bookstore. At the moment it does not need to be an actual store but later on it will be. 
Just show the books on screen, preferably with a search bar.
The project must be finished WITHIN 8 HOURS.

REQUIREMENTS:
• Used technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript/Vue.js.
• Achieve the flip card effect.
• The books data are hosted on a remote JSON.
• Books should be displayed with a little responsive behaviour.
• Include a search engine to search for any field in the book. Whether it be title, description or any other.
• When doing HOVER on each of the covers, it must be rotated to show the title, the description and a “More Info” button.
• This button will take you to a more detailed image of the cover, shown in a LIGHTBOX (popup/modal).

• CHALLANGE: I find it challanging to get the CSS straight using lightbox but I like the possibilities.

• WHAT I LOVED: The one day challange was fun to do. Just one day building something simple jet harder then I thought.
